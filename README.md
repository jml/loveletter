# Love Letter

Love Letter is a card game for two to four people that emphasises deduction,
luck, and risk-taking. It's quick to learn, quick to play, and a lot of fun.
You should buy a copy.

This project tries to implement the basic rules so that other code can
implement clients or servers.

It comes with a very basic command-line interface that you can use to explore
the rules.
