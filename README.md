Just trying to implement the rules.

## notes on rules

Four players. All cards used. One card burnt. Each player dealt a single card.

5 x Soldier: name a player & a non-soldier card, named player loses if correct (1)

2 x Clown: See opponent's hand (2)

2 x Knight: Compare hands with opponent. Lowest card loses. (3)

2 x Priestess: Immune to attack (4)

2 x Wizard: Opponent discards hand (5)

1 x General: Swap hand (6)

1 x Minister: Lose if hand > 12 (7)

1 x Princess: Lose if played or forced to reveal (8)

Game ends when all players are eliminated, or when there are no more cards to
draw and the final player has played.

Winner is either the last player standing, or the player with the
highest-valued card.

## notes on implementation

Essentially focused on implementing minimal logic for adjudicating games.

Phase Two is implementing client layer that does card counting and has a slot
for a user-provided callback.

### representing actions

Two options.

1. Have a `Play` and associate each play with a card.

```
    enum Play {
        Guess(Card, Player),
        Attack(Player),
        Defend,
    }

```

Don't think there's a data-driven way to do this in rust.

2. Have an `Action` type that duplicates cards.

```
    enum Action {
        // name a player & a non-soldier card, named player loses if correct
        UseSoldier(Card, Player),
        // See opponent's hand
        UseClown(Player),
        UseKnight(Player),
        UsePriestess,
        UseWizard(Player),
        UseGeneral(Player),
        UseMinister,
        UsePrincess,
    }
```

## Notation

A game *starts* with a shuffled deck that looks like this:

    [Soldier, Soldier, Soldier, Soldier, Soldier,
     Clown, Clown, Knight, Knight, Priestess, Priestess,
     Wizard, Wizard, General, Minister, Princess]

The first card is burned, the remaining top 5 cards are dealt, each to one
player.

Player 1 draws a card (a Clown), and then must choose to play either a Soldier
or a Clown.
