/// different concept would be to have a very high level game state enum which
/// had different kinds of values depending on whether the game was over or
/// not.

/// else. During the game, there are methods to draw a card, to play it,
/// and (probably) to inspect public state. After the game, the only thing
/// that can happen is you look at who the survivors are, what their cards
/// were, who the winner is, and what the burn card was.
